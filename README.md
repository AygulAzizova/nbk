Naive Bayes Classification on R


These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars.
The analysis determined the quantities of 14 constituents found in each of the three types of wines. 
The attributes are 
1) Type of wine
2) Alcohol 
3) Malic acid 
4) Ash 
5) Alcalinity of ash 
6) Magnesium 
7) Total phenols 
8) Flavanoids 
9) Nonflavanoid phenols 
10) Proanthocyanins 
11)Color intensity 
12)Hue 
13)OD280/OD315 of diluted wines 
14)Proline 

The purpose of the study - according to the chemical analysis of wine (attributes 2)-14)) to determine type of wine (attribute 1)) using naive Bayes classifier
